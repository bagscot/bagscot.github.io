<img  id="sixersLogo"src="sydney-sixers-logo.jpgo" alt="Mountain View" style="width:480px;height:267px;">
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Sydney Sixers are a professional cricket team that play in a tournament called the Big Bash League (BBL).  The BBL is a tournament where every state's capital city chooses the best players in that city that can play in the BBL, some of these players could even be test players.  I will be going into detail about the Sydney Sixers line up later.  The main enemy of the Sydney Sixers in the tournament is the other Sydney team, the Sydney Thunder.  There have been 5 Big Bash Leagues, the Sydney Sixers have got into the finals twice but have only won  once.  There are two Big Bash Leagues the men and the woman's, I will be speaking about the men's Big Bash League ansd the men’s Sydney Sixers team.  This year’s Big Bash Leagues first match is on the 20th of December 2016 and the finals is on 28th of January 2017.  Now that you know about the Sydney Sixers and what they do I will be going through the team of the Sydney Sixers.</p>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<img src="Squad.jpg" alt="Mountain View" style="width:480px;height:267px;">
<p>The squad is Sean Abbott, Jackson Bird, Johan Botha, Ryan Carters, Ben Dwarshuis, Brad Haddin, Josh Hazlewood, Moises Henriques, Nathan Lyon, Nic Maddinson, Steve O’Keefe, Jordan Silk, Mitchell Starc (in alphabetical order).</p>
<h3>Sean Abbot</h3>

<p>Sean Abbot is an allrounder (bats and bowls) and was born in Windsor on February 29th 1992, the  local club he played for in both rugby and cricket was parramatta. Sean Abbotts carrer started when he was 18 when he debuted for NSW.  Although he has had some terrible times in his cricket career such as when he bowled a bouncer and it hit Phillip Hughes (the batsmen) head and he sadly died, there were memorials and moments of silence which only added to his guilt (this was a big part of the history of cricket as they added an extra bit of gear to stop the cricket ball from hitting the back of your head). We wish him the best of luck to him to move on and perform well in BBL 6.  </p>
<h3>Jackson Bird</h3>

Bird has had many achievments including winning sheffield shield player of the year.  His nickname was Squid when he was in the Australian cricket team.  Before he was on the Sydney Sixers he played for the Melbourne Stars in earlier BBL's.  He is a pac bowler, though he is not the quickest but he can swing the ball both ways.   His test debutfor Australia against Sri Lanks in 2012.  He did not stay on the team for long but we hop it will not stop him from playing his best in BBL 6.</p>
